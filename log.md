# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November, 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finalized fundamental rewrite of Rock Paper Scissors project without the use of if/else statements.

**Thoughts:** I'm super excited that I learned this new method of comparing results without using conditional branching. I used a 2D array and indexed the comparisons I needed in to that array, and used the results to get my solution. So excited to learn about that, I want to work more with it th is week.
