# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 5: November, 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Huge progress today. I succesfully manipulated the DOM for the first time. I made a very simple animation on scroll event to change an element's opacity.

**Thoughts:** Really frustrated at a simple mistake I made. I placed my <script> tag above the body content in my main index file, resulting in hours of trying to find the problem with my code. On the bright side I'll likely never made that mistake again!

### Day 4: November, 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today. Set up basic groundwork for "vidscroll" project.

**Thoughts:** Another long day. I'd like to experiment with playing an animation when scrolling down on a web page.

### Day 3: November, 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I added a loop to keep the game looping until either the user or computer has received 2 wins (for a best 2 out of 3). I also added a counter to prevent a Tie from affecting this loop.

**Thoughts:** Very long day, not enough time spent coding/learning. I don't feel that I made much progress. Tomorrow will be different.

### Day 2: November, 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added user input validation to the RPS project. Gained a better understanding of multidimensional arrays.

**Thoughts:** Tough day, was very busy and hard to focus. Still excited about multidimensional arrays and what I'll learn to do with them.

### Day 1: November, 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finalized fundamental rewrite of Rock Paper Scissors project without the use of if/else statements.

**Thoughts:** I'm super excited that I learned this new method of comparing results without using conditional branching. I used a 2D array and indexed the comparisons I needed in to that array, and used the results to get my solution. So excited to learn about that, I want to work more with it th is week.

### Day 0: November, 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began rewrite on first Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project. Rewriting to remove all usage of if else.

**Thoughts:** It's been a busy couple of weeks keeping me away from learning and progressing. I'm excited to jump back in to it and to begin this challenge.
I think rewriting this simple program without the use of if else will help me grow and will help me get back in to things.
