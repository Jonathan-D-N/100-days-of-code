# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November, 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began rewrite on first Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project. Rewriting to remove all usage of if else.

**Thoughts:** It's been a busy couple of weeks keeping me away from learning and progressing. I'm excited to jump back in to it and to begin this challenge.
I think rewriting this simple program without the use of if else will help me grow and will help me get back in to things.
