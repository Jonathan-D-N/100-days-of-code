# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: November, 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I added a loop to keep the game looping until either the user or computer has received 2 wins (for a best 2 out of 3). I also added a counter to prevent a Tie from affecting this loop.

**Thoughts:** Very long day, not enough time spent coding/learning. I don't feel that I made much progress. Tomorrow will be different.
