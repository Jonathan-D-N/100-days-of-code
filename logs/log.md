# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: November, 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added user input validation to the RPS project. Gained a better understanding of multidimensional arrays.

**Thoughts:** Tough day, was very busy and hard to focus. Still excited about multidimensional arrays and what I'll learn to do with them.
